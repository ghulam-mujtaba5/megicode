## Table of Contents

1. **Current SEO Audit**

   - **`robots.txt` Analysis:**
     - The `robots.txt` file is correctly configured to allow all search engines (`User-agent: *`) to crawl the entire site (`Allow: /`).
     - It correctly references the sitemap location (`Sitemap: https://megicode.com/sitemap.xml`).
     - The `Host` directive is deprecated and can be safely removed.

   - **Sitemap Analysis (`sitemap.xml` & `sitemap-0.xml`):**
     - The sitemap correctly uses a sitemap index file, which is best practice.
     - It includes all key pages, including service pages and articles.
     - **Recommendation:** Review the `<changefreq>` and `<priority>` values. Set them based on the actual update frequency and importance of each page for more accurate signaling to search engines.

   - **Package Analysis (`package.json`):**
     - The project uses `next-sitemap` to automatically generate sitemaps, which is excellent for keeping them current.
     - No dedicated SEO library like `next-seo` is present, suggesting that meta tags are likely handled directly in the page components.

   - **Global SEO Configuration (`app/layout.tsx`):**
     - A comprehensive `metadata` object is in place, including title templates, Open Graph, and Twitter cards.
     - **Excellent use of JSON-LD for Organization, WebSite, and SiteNavigationElement structured data.**
     - **Recommendation:** Use environment variables for the `metadataBase` URL to make it easier to manage different environments.

   - **Homepage SEO (`app/page.tsx`):**
     - The homepage currently inherits all SEO settings from the global `layout.tsx`.
     - **Recommendation:** Create a dedicated `metadata` object for the homepage to provide a unique, keyword-rich title and description.

   - **Heading Structure (`<h1>` tags):**
     - The homepage correctly uses an `<h1>` tag within the `WelcomeFrame` component.
     - **Recommendation:** The current heading text ("Welcome to Megicode") is not optimal for SEO. It should be updated to be more descriptive and include primary keywords (e.g., "Custom Software, Web & Mobile App Development").
